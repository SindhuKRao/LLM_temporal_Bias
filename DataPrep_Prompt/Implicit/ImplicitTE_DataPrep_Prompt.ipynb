And the U.S. is taking similar steps to ensure that its naval force is adequate to carry out a blockade of Iraq and support a war if necessary . Over the weekend , Pentagon officials confirmed reports that a fourth U.S. aircraft carrier -- the John F.

Since there is no federal homicide statute as such , the federal officials said Kopp could be charged under the recent Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act , which provides for a sentence of up to life imprisonment for someone convicted of physical assaults or threats against abortion providers . If Kopp were also indicted and convicted on state murder charges , he could face the death penalty . Slepian , a 52-year - old obstetrician and gynecologist who was the mainstay of Buffalo 's only abortion clinic , was shot to death on the night of Oct. 23 as he stood in the kitchen of his home in suburban Amherst , N.Y. chatting with his wife and one of his four sons . No weapon was recovered in the first police searches of the area around Slepian 's home . But on April 8 , investigators , wondering how the assailant could have emerged from the woods without fearing he would be seen carrying a rifle , searched the site of the shooting once more and unearthed a rifle buried one foot below ground 200 feet behind the Slepian home . Clark , the Erie district attorney , said afterwards that investigators think the doctor 's killer buried the rifle in the days before the shooting , unearthed the weapon to fire the fatal shots , then hurriedly reburied it and fled .

The 44-year - old Kopp , who in FBI photographs appears as gaunt and scruffily bearded and whose last known addresses were in Vermont and New Jersey , emerged as the focus of the investigation within two weeks of the slaying .
